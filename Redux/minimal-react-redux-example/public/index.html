      As we are now building this app with React, following the same
      structure and build configuration provided by the highly popular "Create
      React App" project (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app),
      this HTML file is just a skeleton and is no longer significant - the
      entry point of the application is src/index.js.

    <!--
      This HTML file is just a template, with the content managed by React.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      You can add static resources (e.g. webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to
      this file - the Webpack build step will place the bundled scripts into
      the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` in this folder.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build`.
